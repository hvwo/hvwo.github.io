# A Comprehensive Review of Bitcoin's 14-Year Price Journey

Bitcoin's evolution from a niche digital experiment to a global financial phenomenon is one of the most compelling narratives in modern finance. This in-depth analysis explores Bitcoin's price movements over 14 years, examining market cycles, technological advancements, and macroeconomic influences that have shaped its trajectory.

- **First Price Milestone**: By July 2010, Bitcoin reached $0.08 on the now-defunct New Liberty Standard exchange
- **Market Recognition**: 2011 marked Bitcoin's first significant price surge, climbing to $31.91 in June before a dramatic correction
