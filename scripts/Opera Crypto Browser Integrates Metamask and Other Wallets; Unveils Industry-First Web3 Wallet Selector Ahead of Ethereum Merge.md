# Opera Crypto Browser Integrates Metamask and Other Wallets; Unveils Industry-First Web3 Wallet Selector Ahead of Ethereum Merge

Opera‚Äôs crypto-focused browser (available for Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS) has evolved into a truly Web3-ready tool ahead of Ethereum‚Äôs historic merge. This update introduces seamless support for leading third-party wallets like **Metamask** and establishes a groundbreaking feature: the **Web3 Wallet Selector**. This innovation eliminates the need for conflicting extensions, manual settings adjustments, or intrusive pop-ups by letting users choose which wallet interacts with specific dApps directly from the browser‚Äôs address bar.

## What Makes Opera Crypto Browser Unique?

Opera Crypto Browser now supports **Metamask** and hundreds of other wallets accessible via Chrome or Opera extensions. Beyond its native wallet, the browser‚Äôs Wallet Selector aggregates compatible extensions, creating a unified interface for managing multiple wallets. This addresses a critical pain point for crypto users who often juggle multiple wallets to access different networks or features like in-app exchanges and staking.  

### Why This Matters for Web3 Adoption  
The fragmented wallet ecosystem has been a barrier to mainstream adoption. Opera‚Äôs solution streamlines interactions by:  
- **Automatically remembering wallet preferences** for different websites.  
- **Reducing friction** during dApp transactions through one-click wallet switching.  
- **Simplifying onboarding** for new users unfamiliar with wallet management complexities.  

> ‚ÄúWe designed the Wallet Selector based on user feedback,‚Äù says Tomasz Stawarz, Opera‚Äôs Engineering Director. ‚ÄúThis feature eliminates the need to constantly adjust settings or navigate competing extensions, saving users significant time and frustration.‚Äù

### Security Enhancements  
Opera Crypto Browser prioritizes user safety with features like:  
- **Phishing Protection**: Blocks access to known malicious sites.  
- **Secure Clipboard**: Prevents clipboard hijacking during wallet address copying.  
- **Human-Readable Wallet Handles**: Supports YAT, FIO Crypto Handles (e.g., Jane@opera), and ENS domains (e.g., iamtesting.eth) for error-free transactions.

- **Seamless interaction** with decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and NFT platforms.  

Additionally, **PancakeSwap**‚Äîa popular BNB Chain DeFi app‚Äîis now embedded into Opera‚Äôs native wallet. Users can trade tokens directly from their wallet interface without connecting to external dApps.
