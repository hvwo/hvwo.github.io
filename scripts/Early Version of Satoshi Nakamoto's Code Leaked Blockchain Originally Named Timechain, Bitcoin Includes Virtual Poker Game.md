# Early Version of Satoshi Nakamoto's Code Leaked: Blockchain Originally Named Timechain, Bitcoin Includes Virtual Poker Game  

## Decoding the Lost History of Bitcoin's Development  

In March 2019, a groundbreaking discovery shook the cryptocurrency world: an early version of Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin source code was revealed, exposing previously unknown details about the revolutionary digital currency's origins. This leaked code contained radical differences from modern Bitcoin, including abandoned features like a **virtual poker game**, a proposed **P2P platform**, and an entirely different naming convention for blockchain technology.

## The Origins of "Timechain" and the Abandoned Genesis Block  

The earliest iterations of Bitcoin's code reveal fascinating insights into Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision. Key discoveries include:  

- **Timechain**: The blockchain was initially called "timechain" in the source code. This term appears in early documentation describing the structure as a "tree starting from the genesis block," with nodes connecting through "pprev" and "pnext" pointers to form the longest chain.  
- **Different Genesis Block**: Analysis of pre-release code showed an alternate genesis block with a unique hashing algorithm. While the official Bitcoin genesis block was mined on January 3, 2009, this abandoned version potentially dates back to September 10, 2008.  
- **Coin and Cent Terminology**: The smallest Bitcoin units were originally named "coin" (1,000,000) and "cent" (10,000), rather than the now-familiar "satoshi."  

> Satoshi Nakamoto's 2008 email to James A. Donald:  
> *"The branch with the most work is the best branch... Nodes send inventory lists containing transactions and new block hashes. Neighbors request missing items, ensuring redundancy."*

## Secret Features That Never Made It to Bitcoin  

### The Virtual Poker Game Framework  

Buried in the 0.1.0 source code was a framework for a **virtual poker game**, added on April 16, 2008. This feature aimed to demonstrate Bitcoin's potential for decentralized applications (dApps) beyond currency. However, the game was never implemented in the final release.  

### P2P Platform Ambitions  

Early code included plans for a peer-to-peer marketplace similar to OpenBazaar. Satoshi intended to integrate this functionality directly into the Bitcoin protocol, but the feature was abandoned during later development stages.  

### IRC Client Integration  

Bitcoin 0.1.0 originally contained an **Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client** to facilitate decentralized communication. While updated through version 0.8.2, the feature was eventually removed.

## Satoshi's Disappearance and Legacy  

Satoshi Nakamoto maintained control over Bitcoin's code until version 0.3.19, released in 2010. After mysteriously stepping away, development was handed to Gavin Andresen. The reasons for Satoshi's departure remain unknown, but the leaked source code offers tantalizing clues about his unfinished ideas.

## FAQ: Addressing Key Questions About Bitcoin's Lost Code  

**Q: Why was the blockchain originally called "timechain"?**  
A: The term "timechain" reflects the chronological, timestamp-based structure of Bitcoin's ledger. Satoshi later standardized the name to "blockchain" for simplicity.  

**Q: What happened to Bitcoin's virtual poker game?**  
A: The framework was removed during development as the project focused on core monetary functionality.  

**Q: Why did Satoshi abandon the P2P platform plans?**  
A: Prioritization shifted toward perfecting Bitcoin's transaction system. The P2P marketplace concept resurfaced years later in projects like OpenBazaar.  

**Q: How was the alternate genesis block discovered?**  
A: Analysis of pre-release code versions revealed a draft block with a different hashing algorithm, suggesting early experimentation.  

**Q: What impact did Mike Hearn have on Bitcoin's development?**  
A: Hearn, a key contributor, advocated for integrating advanced features but left the project in 2014 amid debates about Bitcoin's scalability.

## Comparative Analysis of Early vs. Modern Bitcoin  

| Feature                | Early Code Version      | Modern Bitcoin         |  
|------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|  
| Blockchain Name        | Timechain               | Blockchain             |  
| Smallest Unit          | Coin (1,000,000)        | Satoshi (1)            |  
| Virtual Poker Game     | Included in 0.1.0       | Removed                |  
| P2P Platform           | Planned integration     | Abandoned              |  
| IRC Client             | Present until 0.8.2     | Removed                |

## The Evolution of "Miners" and Network Participants  

The term "miner" first appeared in code shared with Bitcointalk.org user "Cryddit." In the original whitepaper, participants were simply called "nodes." This shift highlights Satoshi's growing emphasis on the computational work required to secure the network.

## Exploring Satoshi's Rating System Concept  

Early documentation references a proposed **rating system** involving "atoms" and user reviews. While details remain sparse, this suggests Satoshi considered mechanisms for reputation and trust within decentralized systemsâ€”concepts now central to Web3 platforms.

## Unanswered Mysteries in the Leaked Code  

Despite these revelations, critical questions persist:  
- Why did Satoshi abandon the P2P platform?  
- What inspired the shift from "timechain" to "blockchain"?  
- Could the virtual poker game have influenced today's DeFi sector?  

These mysteries underscore Bitcoin's unfinished nature and the enduring relevance of Satoshi's pioneering work.
