# Digital Asset Weekly Report

## Market Analysis

The digital asset market experienced a 5% surge this week, reaching annual highs with a total volume of $39 billion. Despite a 28% decline from last week's $55 billion trading volume, 78% of top 100 digital assets closed positively. This bullish momentum follows optimistic news cycles, with 57% of Bitcoin-related and 61% of general crypto news projecting price increases.

Key market dynamics include:

- **Bitcoin's Technical Position**: Trading below its 50-week moving average ($5,500) suggests tempered momentum
- **RSI Indicator**: Fell from overbought 85 to neutral 66
- **10-Day Rate of Change**: Dropped from +28% to -0.5%
- **Mayer Multiple**: Suggests potential $9,000 Bitcoin target (2x 200-day MA at $4,500)

The market appears to be forming a "second base" pattern after filling the 2018 November gap, potentially setting up for a $200 billion total market cap breakout.

**Q: How should investors position for Q2 volatility?**
