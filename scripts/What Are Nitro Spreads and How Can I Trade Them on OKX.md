# What Are Nitro Spreads and How Can I Trade Them on OKX?

Nitro Spreads is an innovative order book feature within OKX's **Liquid Marketplace**, designed to simplify complex trading strategies. This tool allows traders to execute **spread trades** and **basis trades** seamlessly, leveraging price discrepancies between related assets. Spread trading involves capitalizing on price differences (spreads) of correlated instruments across different markets, such as spot vs. perpetual contracts or futures with varying expiration dates.

Unlike traditional methods requiring manual execution across separate order books, Nitro Spreads enables traders to complete transactions with a single click. All orders are guaranteed to execute at matching quantities for each leg or not at all, minimizing slippage and reducing the risk of partial fills. This feature supports strategies like:

- **Cost of Carry Arbitrage**
- **Spot-Futures Convergence Trading**
- **Calendar Spread Rolling**

## How Spread Trading Works

Spread trading typically involves pairs of instruments sharing the same underlying asset but differing in contract terms. Common combinations include:

1. **Spot vs. Perpetual Futures** (e.g., BTC/USDT Spot vs. BTC/USDT Perpetual)
2. **Spot vs. Quarterly Futures** (e.g., ETH/USDT Spot vs. ETH/USD Quarterly Futures)
3. **Futures with Different Expirations** (e.g., LTC/USDT Quarterly vs. Semi-Annual Futures)

### Delta-Neutral Advantage

A key benefit of spread trading is its **delta-neutral nature**. Delta measures how an instrument's price reacts to movements in the underlying asset. For example, if BTC/USDT rises $1, both its spot and futures prices typically increase by ~$1. By holding opposing positions (long and short), traders eliminate directional risk. This neutrality protects portfolios from volatile price swings while profiting from spread convergence.
