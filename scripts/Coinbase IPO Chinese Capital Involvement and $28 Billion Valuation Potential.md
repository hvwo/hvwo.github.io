# Coinbase IPO: Chinese Capital Involvement and $28 Billion Valuation Potential

## The Long Road to Going Public

Coinbase Global's journey to potential public listing spans nearly a decade of strategic planning and market evolution. On December 18, 2020, the cryptocurrency exchange giant officially filed for an IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), marking a historic milestone as the first major crypto platform to pursue capital market integration. This move comes amid Bitcoin's record-breaking price surge, creating optimal market conditions for such a significant transition.

### Early IPO Rumors and Financials

Speculation about Coinbase's public offering began as early as October 2018, when CNBC analyst Ran NeuNer revealed conversations with early investor Adam Draper about a potential $500 million IPO. At the time, the platform boasted 25 million users (600,000 active) with projected $1.3 billion revenue and $456 million profit for 2018 - figures significantly higher than 2017's $380 million profit.

While some industry figures like DGroup founder Dong Zhao criticized the move as contradictory to crypto's decentralized ethos, market conditions ultimately dictated the timeline. The 2018 crypto winter temporarily delayed plans, but Bitcoin's renewed bullish momentum in 2020 reignited IPO discussions.

### Valuation Evolution

The platform's valuation has grown dramatically alongside Bitcoin's price surge. While its 2018 E-round financing placed value at $8 billion (when BTC traded around $5,000), contemporary analyses suggest much higher figures:

| Valuation Source | Date | Estimated Value | Methodology |
|------------------|------|-----------------|-------------|
| Tiger Global-led E-round | Nov 2018 | $8 billion | Institutional funding |
| Analyst Lex model | July 2020 | $15 billion | 20x revenue multiple |
| Messari analysis | Dec 2020 | $28 billion | Business segment analysis |

Mira Christanto of Messari's $28 billion assessment considers Coinbase's transaction fees, custody services (growing from $7 billion in 2019 to $20 billion in 2020), and crypto market dynamics. This represents a 250% increase from 2018 valuations, closely tracking Bitcoin's 360% price increase during the same period.

### IPO vs. Direct Listing Debate

Despite widespread "IPO" references, Coinbase's exact listing mechanism remains undetermined. The company only confirmed submitting confidential S-1 filings to the SEC - a requirement for both IPOs and direct listings. Key considerations include:

**Direct Listing Advantages:**
- Avoids $70 million+ investment banking fees (vs. Lyft's IPO costs)
- Immediate liquidity for existing shareholders
- Eliminates lock-up periods

**Traditional IPO Benefits:**
- Price stabilization mechanisms
- New capital infusion
- Institutional underwriting support

This decision reflects Coinbase's anti-Wall Street ethos, with co-founder Fred Ehrsam even proposing blockchain-based token listings as alternative options.

### Chinese Capital's Strategic Investments

While U.S.-based venture firms like a16z and Tiger Global dominate Coinbase's investor roster, Chinese capital has played a significant early role:

Coinbase's growth trajectory hasn't been without controversy:

**BCH Listing Lawsuits:**
- 2017: Accused of enabling insider trading during BCH listing
