## Key Terms and Formulas  

### 1. Position Size  
Position size determines the scale of your investment. In **One-way mode**, long positions are positive numbers, and short positions are negative. In **Hedge mode**, both long and short positions are positive.  

### 2. Entry Price Calculation  
Your entry price adjusts with position changes. Formulas vary by margin type:  

**U-Stablecoin-Margined Contracts:**  
```  
Entry Price = (Current Size Ã— Entry Price + Added Size Ã— Added Size's Entry Price) / (Current Size + Added Size)  
```  

**Coin-Margined Contracts:**  
```  
Entry Price = (Current Size + Added Size) / (Current Size / Entry Price + Added Size / Added Size's Entry Price)  
```

## Floating PnL Explained  

Floating PnL reflects unrealized gains/losses based on current market prices.  

**U-Stablecoin-Margined Contracts:**  
- **Long Positions:**  
  ```  
  Face Value Ã— |Size| Ã— Multiplier Ã— (Mark Price - Entry Price)  
  ```  
- **Short Positions:**  
  ```  
  Face Value Ã— |Size| Ã— Multiplier Ã— (Entry Price - Mark Price)  
  ```  

**Coin-Margined Contracts:**  
- **Long Positions:**  
  ```  
  Face Value Ã— |Size| Ã— Multiplier Ã— (1/Entry Price - 1/Mark Price)  
  ```  
- **Short Positions:**  
  ```  
  Face Value Ã— |Size| Ã— Multiplier Ã— (1/Mark Price - 1/Entry Price)  
  ```

## Floating PnL Ratio  

This ratio measures profitability relative to margin:  
```  
Floating PnL Ratio = (Floating PnL / Position's Margin) Ã— 100%  
```  
For example, a 6000 USDT floating PnL with 1600 USDT margin equals a 375% floating PnL ratio.

## Closed PnL and Settlement PnL  

**Closed PnL** applies to exited positions:  
- **U-Stablecoin-Margined:**  
  ```  
  Face Value Ã— |Size| Ã— Multiplier Ã— (Close Price - Entry Price)  
  ```  
- **Coin-Margined:**  
  ```  
  Face Value Ã— |Size| Ã— Multiplier Ã— (1/Close Price - 1/Entry Price)  
  ```  

**Settlement PnL** occurs during contract settlement:  
- Formulas mirror closed PnL but use **settlement price** instead of close price.

## Realized PnL Breakdown  

Realized PnL combines closed positions, settlements, and trading fees:  
```  
Realized PnL = Closed PnL + Settlement PnL + Trading Fee  
```  
The **realized PnL ratio** is calculated as:  
```  
(Realized PnL / Closed Position's Margin) Ã— 100%  
```

## Practical Examples  

### Example 1: U-Stablecoin-Margined Entry Price Adjustment  
- **Initial Position:** 10 BTC-USDT contracts @ $100,000  
- **Added Position:** 5 contracts @ $160,000  
- **New Entry Price:**  
  ```  
  (100,000 Ã— 10 + 160,000 Ã— 5) / (10 + 5) = $120,000 USDT  
  ```  

### Example 2: Coin-Margined Short Position  
- **Initial Position:** 10 BTC-USD contracts @ $100,000  
- **Added Position:** 5 contracts @ $80,000  
- **New Entry Price:**  
  ```  
  (10 + 5) / (10/100,000 + 5/80,000) = $92,307 USD  
  ```

## Floating PnL Case Study  

**U-Stablecoin-Margined Long Position:**  
- Face Value: 0.01 BTC  
- Size: 10 contracts  
- Entry Price: $100,000  
- Mark Price: $160,000  
- **PnL:**  
  ```  
  0.01 Ã— 10 Ã— 1 Ã— (160,000 - 100,000) = 6,000 USDT  
  ```  

**Coin-Margined Short Position:**  
- Face Value: $100  
- Size: 1,000 contracts  
- Entry Price: $100,000  
- Mark Price: $80,000  
- **PnL:**  
  ```  
  100 Ã— 1,000 Ã— 1 Ã— (1/80,000 - 1/100,000) = 0.25 BTC  
  ```

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)  

### Q1: Whatâ€™s the difference between floating and realized PnL?  
Floating PnL shows unrealized gains/losses based on current prices, while realized PnL reflects profits/losses from closed positions or settlements.  

### Q2: How does position size affect margin requirements?  
Larger positions require higher margins. Always calculate your margin using:  
```  
Margin = Face Value Ã— |Size| Ã— Entry Price (for U-stablecoin)  
```  

### Q3: Can trading fees impact realized PnL?  
Yes, fees reduce realized PnL. Use platforms with transparent fee structures like OKX.  

### Q4: Why do coin-margined contracts use reciprocal prices?  
Coin-margined contracts denominate profits/losses in the asset itself, requiring reciprocal calculations for accurate results.  

### Q5: How often do futures contracts settle?  
Expiry futures settle once at contract expiration, while perpetual contracts may settle daily.
